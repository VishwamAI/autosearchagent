# Auto Search Agent Design Document

## Overview
The Auto Search Agent is designed to handle complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks. It will perform web scraping, natural language processing, and summarization to provide accurate and concise information. The agent will be built using the best libraries and models from Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, LLaMA, and more, without utilizing any external APIs.

## Components

### 1. Query Handling
- **Input Parsing**: The agent will receive queries in natural language and parse them to understand the intent and extract relevant keywords.
- **Query Breakdown**: Complex queries will be broken down into smaller sub-queries to facilitate more efficient searching and processing.

### 2. Search Strategies
- **Web Scraping**: The agent will use libraries such as Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium/Playwright to scrape data from web pages.
- **Information Retrieval**: The agent will perform searches using the parsed queries and retrieve relevant information from various sources.

### 3. Result Verification
- **Cross-Referencing**: The agent will verify the accuracy of the retrieved information by cross-referencing multiple sources.
- **Relevance Filtering**: The agent will filter out irrelevant or low-quality information to ensure the results are reliable.

### 4. Summarization
- **Text Summarization**: The agent will use libraries such as Gensim, spaCy, TextBlob, and NLTK to condense the retrieved information into concise summaries.
- **Context Preservation**: The summarization process will ensure that the key context and important details are preserved.

### 5. Additional Features
- **Code-Related Queries**: The agent will handle code-related queries with precision, providing accurate solutions and explanations.
- **Real-Time Facts**: The agent will use Google for quick, unambiguous fact-based queries and look up real-time facts and current events.

## Workflow

1. **Receive Query**: The agent receives a query from the user.
2. **Parse Query**: The query is parsed to understand the intent and extract keywords.
3. **Break Down Query**: Complex queries are broken down into smaller sub-queries.
4. **Perform Search**: The agent performs web scraping and information retrieval using the sub-queries.
5. **Verify Results**: The retrieved information is cross-referenced and filtered for accuracy and relevance.
6. **Summarize Information**: The verified information is summarized into a concise and coherent response.
7. **Return Response**: The summarized information is returned to the user.

## Conclusion
The Auto Search Agent will be a powerful tool for handling complex queries, providing accurate and concise information through web scraping, natural language processing, and summarization. The design outlined in this document will guide the implementation and ensure the agent meets the user's requirements.
